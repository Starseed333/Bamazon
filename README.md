#**Bamazon**
MySQL CLI App



An interactive shopping application which implements a simmple command line. The application has two
interfaces, the Customer and Manager. This is a Node app using MySQL as a database.

* **The Customer**

The Customer interface allows the user to view the current inventory of the store in a friendly back-end
table display easy to read. The items are listed by an item number, this allows the user for easy access
to the item they are interested in. The user is then prompted to select their item followed by a confirmation wether or not the item is in stock. If the item is in stock they are then prompted with the cost of the item.

* **The Manager**

The Manager interface like the Customer interface also allows the user to view the current inventory of the 
store in the friendly back-end table display. The user has three options Restock current Inventory, Add a New Product and Remove Obsolete Inventory. This is done by selecting the item id and choosing one of the available
options. Once their selection is complete **A**) A new item is added to the current inventory **B**) A current item gets restocked and **C**) An obsolete item gets removed from the inventory as we all know to well the losses this causes for any company.
